**Who is mat?**
I am mat. I am a human that lives somewhere on a planet called Earth, you might've heard of it.

**What do you do?**
I do dev. To clarify, I mean dev as in software development.

**Why do you write your name in lowercase?**
Because I can and no one can stop me.

**What type of stuff do you make?**
I make a variety of different tools, and you can see some of those things in [my project list](/projects) on this website. The list isn't complete though, as a lot of things I make aren't particularly presentable.

**What programming languages do you use?**
I mainly use Python, as it's the language I'm most comfortable writing with. I'm also proficient with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I also know limited amounts of C++, C, Go, and Java.

**How did you make this website?**
2022 update: This website was rewritten in Svelte.
The backend for this website was written by me in pure [Python](https://www.python.org/) with beautiful asynchronous [aiohttp.web](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/) and [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/).
The frontend was made with [VanillaJS](http://vanilla-js.com)

**How can I contact you?**
You can contact me through Discord (mat#1592).
