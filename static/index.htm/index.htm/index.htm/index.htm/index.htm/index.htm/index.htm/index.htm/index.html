		<h1>Welcome to Jetty 9 on Debian</h1>

		<p align="justify">
			<b>Jetty</b> is a 100% Java HTTP Server and Servlet Container. This means that you do not need
			to configure and run a seperate web server (like Apache) in order to use java, servlets and
			JSPs to generate dynamic content. Jetty is a fully featured web server for static and dynamic
			content. Unlike separate server/container solutions, this means that your web server and web
			application run in the same process, without interconnection overheads and complications.
			Furthermore, as a pure java component, Jetty can be simply included in your application for
			demonstration, distribution or deployment. Jetty is available on all Java supported platforms.
